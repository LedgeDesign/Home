Wellsville asked me to develop artwork for their first cd release and develop a logo and icon for their recording company, Suburban Songs. They wanted something which could be reproduced cheaply, so I developed high contrast black and white artwork which could easily be photocopied, trimmed and folded so they could take a DIY approach to assembling and burning cd's as needed.
