Verizon's bilingual website, www.atodoloqueda.com, mutlicultural achievements and enabled U.S. Hispanics to experience and express their passions about their culture. Part of this site was an artist call and response series. They developed an online poll where their customers where given a week to cast their vote for topics with multiple choice answers. When the most popular answer was revealed, the participating artists had 24 hours to respond with a visual statement. I took part in two of these polls. The first question was "Which is your favorite doctor?" whose answer was "Dr. Phil". The second question was "How do wake up in the morning" whose answer was "Hit the snooze button and fall back asleep." It was left up to the artist to represent these answer anyway they saw fit, here are my results.
