As StageKey is based in Indianapolis, IN, our communication was mostly based on napkin sketches, phone calls, and emails as we worked together to make their concepts a reality. Through the use of SketchUp and Vectorkworks, I developed many ideas through basic wireframes before creating polished renderings we could used to pitch to the client.
