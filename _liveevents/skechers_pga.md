Premier Displays & Exhibits • Skechers PGA Merchadise • 3D Conceptual Designer

Designed this Skechers 40' x 50' booth for the annual PGA Merchadise Show in Orlando, FL. The PGA Merchadise Show explores 1,000+ interactive exhibits showcasing the latest products in apparel/apparel accessories, technology, equipment, training aids, travel and more. Designed at Premier Displays & Exhibits, I coordinated with my engineering team, production staff and install crew to present a booth design which incorporates displays for all of Skechers Performance GO GOLF Categories, demonstration areas for sponsored professionals on the PGA Tour, and private conference room for the Skechers sales team and in-booth storage for product.
