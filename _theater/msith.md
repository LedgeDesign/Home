Adapted for the stage by Matthew Francis, this was my first production as a theater set designer. The play was preformed by the University Players while attending their M.F.A. program at California State University, Long Beach. Included here are photos of the production's 1/2" scale model, the actual stage and performers, and the collection of life sized puppets I created, including a three-faced English judge. Along with being the Set Designer for this production, other responsibilities included puppetry, painting, welding, and carpentry.
