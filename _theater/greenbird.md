The Green Bird
by Carlo Gozzi

The Green Bird is an 18th century commedia dell'arte play by Carlo Gozzi with English translation by Albert Bermel and Ted Emery. This is a 1/2" scale model for the play which I designed for the California Repertory Company while attending their M.F.A. program at California State University, Long Beach.
